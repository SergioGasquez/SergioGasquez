## Hey 👋, I'm Sergio Gasquez!

### Glad to see you here!

Hello, I'm Sergio Gasquez, a Telecommunications Engineer with a Master's degree in Electronic Systems for Intelligent Environments. My true passion lies in Firmware and Embedded Systems Programming, and I've gained extensive experience in this field through various roles in the tech industry.

I started my career as a Firmware Engineer at HP in Barcelona, where I developed security features for the Ink Delivery System.In 2020, I relocated to A Coruña and joined Instituto Tecnológico de Galicia (ITG) as an Embedded Software Developer, where I developed firmware for a drone in a box solution. 

In March 2021, I joined RTI as a Software Developer for Connext Micro. There, I was part of the team developing a connectivity framework based on the DDS standard for resource-constrained applications.

Currently, I am part of [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/)'s Rust team, where I'm learning Rust 🦀 and while contributing to [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs) organization, which enables Rust on ESP32 chips.

I am a passionate technologist 👨‍💻 who enjoys learning new things 💡, especially in electronics 🤖 and programming 💻! In my spare time I love doing sports 🧗, travelling 🌍, and listening to music 🤟.

If you want to know more about me, here is my [personal wiki](https://sergiogasquez.notion.site/Personal-Wiki-0d2f9be521094316aa12fcbbc5d20fab), where I share most of the things I know.
