### Hi there 👋

<!--
**SergioGasquez/SergioGasquez** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Sergio Gasquez, I’m a Telecommunications Engineer with Masters in Electronic Systems for Intelligent Environments who loves Firmware and Embedded Systems Programming. I was born in Granada and after graduating, I moved to Barcelona to work as a Firmware Engineer in HP, where I developed security features for the Ink Delivery System. At the beginning of 2020, I reallocated into A Coruña to work as an Embedded Sofware Developer in Instituto Tecnológico de Galicia (ITG). At ITG I am in charge of developing firmware for a “drone in a box” solution.
