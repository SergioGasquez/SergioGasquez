### Hi there 👋

My name is Sergio Gasquez, I’m a Telecommunications Engineer with Masters in Electronic Systems for Intelligent Environments who loves Firmware and Embedded Systems Programming. I was born in Granada and after graduating, I moved to Barcelona to work as a Firmware Engineer in HP, where I developed security features for the Ink Delivery System. At the beginning of 2020, I reallocated into A Coruña to work as an Embedded Sofware Developer at Instituto Tecnológico de Galicia (ITG) where ITG I was in charge of developing firmware for a “drone in a box solution”. In March 2021 I joined RTI as a Software Developer for Connext Micro, a connectivity framework based on the DDS standard for resource-constrained applications. Currently, I am learning Rust 🦀 while contributing to [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs).

I am a passionate technologist 👨‍💻 who enjoys learning new things 💡, especially electronics 🤖 and programming 💻! In my spare time I love doing sports 🧗 🏊‍♂️ 🥾, traveling 🌍, and listening to music 🤟.
